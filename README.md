##Summary

Overall, the orginal code worked fine but refactoring it made it more efficient.
It allowed us to removed redundancies and duplications improve the effectiveness of the code. However, going through the process of refactoring requires focus because any part done wrong could introduce new bugs and errors that may be challenging and time consuming to deal with.
